    <p>So when we hear about ASIA what comes in our mind?</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, <br> located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres. <br> It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe <br> and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa</p>
    <h4>But over here we will tell you some intresting facts :)</h4>
  <h5>1. Itâ€™s the largest continent on the planet</h5>
  <p>Asia is a massive continent with a total size of 44,579,000 km2 (17,212,000 sq mi), and if that wasnâ€™t enough, itâ€™s also the most populous continent in the world. The largest countries in the world can be found here such as Russia, China, and India. 
<br>
    And it doesnâ€™t end there because Asia is actually part of the supercontinent known as Eurasia, and the Asian and European continents arenâ€™t technically separated. </p>

    <h5>2. Asia has the highest number of billionaires in the world</h5>
  <p>In recent years, the world economy has shifted, and there are now more billionaires on the Asian continent than anywhere else in the world. China alone has more billionaires than the US, which continue to fall behind the rising Asian economies. 

    This is definitely one of the most interesting facts about Asia.</p>

    <h5>3. Home to the highest mountains in the world</h5>
  <p>14 of the tallest mountains in the world can be found in Asia, and they are all over 8000 meters above the sea. The highest mountain in the world is Mount Everest at 8 848 meters above the sea. </p>
  <h5>4. Itâ€™s incredibly biodiverse</h5>
  <p>Itâ€™s not only humans that are thriving, and the continent is home to a wide range of animals and plants. For example, on the Asian continent, you can see wild elephants, tigers, snow leopards, orangutans, and many more, including some of the most venomous snakes in the world. 
<br>
    However, due to cities expanding and the demand for agriculture rises, humans are rapidly taking over the animalâ€™s natural environments. On top of that, there is a serious plastic pollution problem on the continent, which lead to death and destruction of habitats as well.</p>

    <h5>5. 60% of the worldâ€™s population live in Asia</h5>
  <p>The Asian continent is home to 4,46 billion people, which account for more than 60% of the total human population on Earth. China and India are home to 2,6 billion people, and those are just two countries. 
<br><br>
    The Asian population is continuing to grow, although experts expect to see drops as the countries become more developed</p>
